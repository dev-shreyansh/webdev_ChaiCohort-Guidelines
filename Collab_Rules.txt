1. Communication Etiquette
    Use Appropriate Channels: Slack, Teams, or email for different purposes. Use threads and tags to keep conversations organized.
    Be Clear and Concise: When asking for help, provide enough context and details (e.g., error messages, code snippets).
    Respect Time Zones: If it’s a global team, be mindful of others' working hours.
2. Code Collaboration Standards
    Version Control Discipline: Use Git or similar tools with proper branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow).
    Write Clear Commit Messages: Follow conventions like “Imperative mood” (e.g., Fix bug in login flow).
    Code Reviews: Participate actively and constructively. Give feedback that’s specific, actionable, and respectful.
    Pull Requests (PRs): Keep them small, focused, and well-documented. Link them to relevant tasks or issues.
3. Documentation Expectations
    Comment Thoughtfully: Write comments for complex logic but avoid over-commenting obvious code.
    Update Documentation: Keep README files, API docs, and internal wikis current.
    Write Specs/Proposals: For bigger changes, draft technical specs and circulate them for feedback.
4. Coding Practices
    Follow Coding Standards: Stick to language-specific style guides (e.gx., PEP8 for Python, Airbnb for JavaScript).
    Write Tests: Unit tests, integration tests, and ensure code coverage thresholds are met.
    Don’t Break the Build: Always ensure your code passes tests before merging.
5. Meetings and Standups
    Daily Standups: Keep updates brief—what you did, what you’re doing, blockers.
    Sprint Planning/Retros: Engage in planning sessions and give constructive feedback in retrospectives.
6. Respect and Inclusivity
    Respect Diverse Opinions: Tech discussions can get heated; maintain professionalism.
    Help Others: Be open to mentoring juniors or onboarding new teammates.
    Acknowledge Contributions: Give credit where it's due, whether it’s in code reviews or during meetings.
7. Security & Confidentiality
    Secure Code Practices: Be mindful of sensitive data, avoid hardcoding credentials, and follow secure coding guidelines.
    Respect NDAs: Don’t share proprietary code or information outside the company.
8. Tool and Environment Usage
    Use Approved Tools: Stick to company-sanctioned IDEs, libraries, or frameworks unless otherwise discussed.
    Maintain Local Environment: Ensure your local dev environment mirrors production as closely as possible.
